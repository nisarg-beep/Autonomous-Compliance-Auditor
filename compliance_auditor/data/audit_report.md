# Compliance Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-11-30 21:21:32
**File Analyzed:** Vendor_Service_Agreement.txt
**Compliance Score:** 25/100

## Executive Summary
❌ **CRITICAL VIOLATIONS DETECTED.** Immediate review required.

## Detailed Findings
### Violation 1
- **Issue:** Payment terms (Net 90 days) exceed the absolute maximum duration permitted by company policy (which prohibits terms exceeding 90 days entirely).
- **Severity:** High
- **Policy Reference:** Global_Procurement_Policy_2025.txt (PAYMENT TERMS)
- **Recommendation:** Immediately revise payment terms to Net 45 days. If necessary, terms up to Net 60 may be negotiated only with explicit, documented written approval from the CFO. Net 90 days is strictly prohibited.

### Violation 2
- **Issue:** The Vendor's Limitation of Liability clause does not meet the mandatory minimum required cap.
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Policy Reference:** Global_Procurement_Policy_2025.txt (LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION, 2.1)
- **Recommendation:** The annual contract value is $150,000 (2x = $300,000). Since $1,000,000 is greater than $300,000, the liability cap must be revised to a minimum of $1,000,000.

### Violation 3
- **Issue:** The contract is governed by the laws of the State of California, violating the mandatory requirement for New York State Law.
- **Severity:** High
- **Policy Reference:** Global_Procurement_Policy_2025.txt (GOVERNING LAW)
- **Recommendation:** The Governing Law clause must be changed to mandate that the contract be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

### Violation 4
- **Issue:** The dispute resolution venue is set as San Francisco, CA, violating the policy requirement that arbitration clauses (if included) must be conducted in New York City.
- **Severity:** High
- **Policy Reference:** Global_Procurement_Policy_2025.txt (GOVERNING LAW)
- **Recommendation:** The venue for all dispute resolution mechanisms (including arbitration) must be revised to New York City, NY.

### Violation 5
- **Issue:** The mandatory contractual requirement for the Vendor to indemnify the Company against third-party claims arising from intellectual property infringement or data breaches is absent from the document.
- **Severity:** High
- **Policy Reference:** Global_Procurement_Policy_2025.txt (LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION, 2.2)
- **Recommendation:** Add a specific indemnification clause (Policy 2.2) requiring the Vendor to indemnify the Company against claims related to IP infringement and data breaches.
